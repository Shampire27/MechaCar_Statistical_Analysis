## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- **Q: Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**
    **A:** Vehicle length and ground clearance

- **Q: Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**
    **A:** Yes, because based on the summary result, adjusted R-squared = 0.6825, which means the strength of corralation is moderate, so that the slope of the linear model is considered to be 0.

- **Q: Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**
    **A:** Yes, because the p-value is equal to 5.35e-11, which is smaller than 0.05.
